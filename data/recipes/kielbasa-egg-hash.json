        "Slice the Kielbasa into 1/2 in pieces.",
        "Set a pan to medium-high heat and add the olive oil. Let it heat for about 1 minute.",
        "Add the Kielbasa, cook until slightly seared, about 2-3 minutes, then flip for another minute.",
        "Move the Kielbasa to the sides of the pan; add the grated potato, spreading out as thin as possible. Sprinkle garlic powder across the potatoes. If using rosemary, sprinkle a little bit onto the potatoes as well.",
        "When the edges start to crisp, flip the potato for another minute.",
        "To ensure all shreds of the potato cook, pull apart and mix around using two spatulas.",
        "Crack the eggs into the pan and scramble into the potatoes, while incorporating the Kielbasa into the mix, about 30 seconds.",
        "Remove from heat and serve with salt and pepper"
