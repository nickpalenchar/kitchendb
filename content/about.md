KitchenDB brings you the joy of free recipes, without having to fight through ads or personal stories.

It's the fastest place to get straight to a recipe. A website that doesn't have ads or
trackers competing with loading content makes recipes easy to load and easy to use.

### Free recipes

Cooking is a fundamental part of living and should be available to all. All recipes are free to use
and distribute.

### No Ads

Rather than spending time loading ads, kitchenDB has a simple recipe to load and loads it quickly. 

### No Stories

Literally just the recipe. 

### Open Source

The code and recipe data is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/nickpalenchar/kitchendb). 
If you're a developer you can contribute to the site.

If you're anyone with a recipe, you can help contribute by [submitting](/submit) it!
