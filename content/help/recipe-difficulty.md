Recipes are ranked from 1-5 depending on the difficulty.

The difficulty is quite subjective, and some skills in a difficult range could come easily to some chefs. With that in mind, below is a general overview of what to expect in each level.

## Level 1 {{< recipe-difficulty difficulty=1 >}} Very Easy 


This recipe is more "assembling" than cooking. Ingredients are easy to prepare if they need to be prepared at all. If there is actual
cooking, the amount of heat/time does not have to be too precise as there is room for error. This recipe can often be done while being
distracted the whole time.

**Examples**: [Slow Cooker Chicken Taco Bowls](http://preview.kitchendb.net/recipes/slow-cooker-chicken-taco-bowls/), [Tuna Pat√©](http://preview.kitchendb.net/recipes/tuna-pat%C3%A9/).


## Level 2: {{< recipe-difficulty difficulty=2 >}} Easy

Recipe is a good introduction to cooking, and is often some of the first recipes humans learn to cook. Ingredients may require some
basic preparation (chopping at various sizes, mincing), and there may be one part where it's important to focus on the dish to ensure the step is complete (such as making sure chicken is slightly browned). Simple baking is also included in this category.

**Examples**: [Smoked Gouda and Broccoli Flatbreads](/recipes/slow-cooker-chicken-taco-bowls/), [Reddit's "Murder Cookies" (modern version)](/recipes/tuna-pat%C3%A9/).

## Level 3: {{< recipe-difficulty difficulty=3 >}} Slightly Challenging

Recipe may require some previous cooking experience, but with enough confidence one can probably achieve the dish without it. There
may be multiple large steps, some which may be recommended to be done simultaneously, and focus is a large factor. Some steps
may require a bit of "instinct" to determine its done (e.g. smelling that aromatics (garlic) are fragrant or seeing that a sauce is
reduced). May require precise controlling of heat and time where small variants could be consequential (e.g. searing).

If the steps are all Level 2, but there is a large amount that it requires a more sustained focus, the recipe might also be Level 3.

**Examples**: [Sweet potato casserole](/recipes/sweet-potato-casserole/)

## Level 4: {{< recipe-difficulty difficulty=4 >}} Challenging

Recipe requires previous cooking experience with similar dishes to guarantee success. There may be 2 or 3 more steps to multi-task
at the same time, or require very precise timing. Over- or underdoing some steps may result in failure that can't be recovered from.

**Examples**: [Samosas](/recipes/samosas/)

## Level 5: {{< recipe-difficulty difficulty=5 >}} Very Challenging

These are expert-level recipes that often require formal training to guarantee success.

**Examples**: _None yet (why not [submit one?]({{< param "submitLink" >}}))_
